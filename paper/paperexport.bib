  abstract =      {Merging compact binaries are currently regarded as
                   the most promising source of gravitational waves for
                   the planned Earth-based LIGO/VIRGO
                   laser-interferometer detector system, and will be an
                   important source also for similar, lower-frequency
                   detectors that might be flown in space (e.g., the
                   proposed LISA mission). During the orbital inspiral,
                   if one or both bodies are rapidly rotating, the
                   general relativistic spin-orbit and spin-spin
                   coupling (i.e., the ``dragging of inertial frames''
                   by the bodies' spins) cause the binary's orbital
                   plane to process. In this paper we analyze the
                   resulting modulation of the inspiral gravitational
                   waveform, using post2-Newtonian equations to describe
                   the precession of the orbital plane, but only the
                   leading-order (Newtonian, quadrupole-moment
                   approximation) equations to describe the orbit, the
                   radiation reaction, the inspiral, and the wave
                   generation. We derive all the formulas one needs to
                   readily compute the spin-modulated gravitational
                   waveform (within the post-Newtonian approximation and
                   the approximation that the precession frequency is
                   much smaller than the orbital frequency). We also
                   develop intuition into what the modulated signals
                   ``look like,'' by a variety of means. We provide
                   approximate, analytical solutions for the
                   precessional motion and the modulated waveforms for
                   two important special cases: the case where the
                   bodies have nearly equal masses and the case where
                   one of the bodies has negligible spin. For these
                   cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters,
                   the motion is a simple precession of the orbital
                   angular momentum around the nearly fixed direction of
                   the total angular momentum, with a few tens of
                   precession periods as the waves sweep through the
                   LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin
                   and orbital angular momenta are approximately
                   antialigned, there is a transitional-precession epoch
                   during which their near cancellation causes the
                   binary to ``lose its gyroscopic bearings'' and tumble
                   in space, with a corresponding peculiar sweep of the
                   waveform modulation. We also explore numerically the
                   precessional behaviors that occur for general masses
                   and spins; these typically appear quite similar to
                   our special-case, simple-precession, and
                   transitional-precession solutions. An Appendix
                   develops several diagrammatic aids for understanding
                   intuitively the relation between the precessing orbit
                   and the modulated waveform.},

  abstract =      {Binary black holes (BBHs) on quasicircular orbits are
                   fully characterized by their total mass $M$, mass
                   ratio $q$, spins $\mathbf{S}_1$ and $\mathbf{S}_2$,
                   and orbital angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$. When the
                   binary separation $r \gg GM/c^2$, the precession
                   timescale is much shorter than the radiation-reaction
                   time on which $L = |\mathbf{L}|$ decreases due to
                   gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We use conservation
                   of the total angular momentum $\mathbf{J} =
                   \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}_1 + \mathbf{S}_2$ (with
                   magnitude $J$) and the projected effective spin $\xi
                   \equiv M^{-2} [(1+q) \mathbf{S}_1 +
                   (1+q^{-1})\mathbf{S}_2] \cdot \hat{\mathbf{L}}$ on
                   the precession time to derive an effective potential
                   for BBH spin precession. This effective potential
                   allows us to solve the orbit-averaged spin-precession
                   equations analytically for arbitrary mass ratios and
                   spins. These solutions are quasiperiodic functions of
                   time: after a period $\tau(L, J, \xi)$ the angular
                   momenta return to their initial relative orientations
                   and precess about $\mathbf{J}$ by an angle $\alpha(L,
                   J, \xi)$. We classify BBH spin precession into three
                   distinct morphologies between which BBHs can
                   transition during their inspiral. Our new solutions
                   constitute fundamental progress in our understanding
                   of BBH spin precession and also have important
                   astrophysical applications. We derive a
                   precession-averaged evolution equation $dJ/dL$ that
                   can be numerically integrated on the
                   radiation-reaction time, allowing us to statistically
                   track BBH spins from formation to merger far more
                   efficiently than was possible with previous
                   orbit-averaged precession equations. This will
                   greatly help us predict the signatures of BBH
                   formation in the GWs emitted near merger and the
                   distributions of final spins and gravitational
                   recoils. The solutions may also help efforts to model
                   and interpret GWs from generic BBH mergers.},

                   timescale hierarchy to develop a multi-scale analysis
                   of BBH dynamics elaborating on the analysis of [1].
                   We solve the spin-precession equations analytically
                   on the precession time and then implement a
                   quasi-adiabatic approach to evolve these solutions on
                   the longer radiation-reaction time. This procedure
                   leads to an innovative ‚Äúprecession- averaged‚Äù
                   post-Newtonian approach to studying precessing BBHs.
                   We use our new solutions to classify BBH spin
                   precession into three distinct morphologies, then
                   investigate phase transitions between these
                   morphologies as BBHs inspiral. These
                   precession-averaged post-Newtonian inspirals can be
                   efficiently calculated from arbitrarily large
                   separations, bridging the gap between astrophysics
                   and numerical relativity.},

  abstract =      {Binary black holes on quasicircular orbits with spins
                   aligned with their orbital angular momentum have been
                   testbeds for analytic and numerical relativity for
                   decades, not least because symmetry ensures that such
                   configurations are equilibrium solutions to the
                   spin-precession equations. In this work, we show that
                   these solutions can be unstable when the spin of the
                   higher-mass black hole is aligned with the orbital
                   angular momentum and the spin of the lower-mass black
                   hole is anti-aligned. Spins in these configurations
                   are unstable to precession to large misalignment when
                   the binary separation $r$ is between the values
                   $r_{\rm ud\pm}= (\sqrt{\chi_1} \pm \sqrt{q \chi_2})^4
                   (1-q)^{-2} M$, where $M$ is the total mass, $q \equiv
                   m_2/m_1$ is the mass ratio, and $\chi_1$ ($\chi_2$)
                   is the dimensionless spin of the more (less) massive
                   black hole. This instability exists for a wide range
                   of spin magnitudes and mass ratios and can occur in
                   the strong-field regime near merger. We describe the
                   origin and nature of the instability using recently
                   developed analytical techniques to characterize fully
                   generic spin precession. This instability provides a
                   channel to circumvent astrophysical spin alignment at
                   large binary separations, allowing significant spin
                   precession prior to merger affecting both
                   gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signatures of
                   stellar-mass and supermassive binary black holes.},

  abstract =      {Previous analytic and numerical calculations suggest
                   that, at each instant, the emission from a precessing
                   black hole binary closely resembles the emission from
                   a nonprecessing analog. In this paper we
                   quantitatively explore the validity and limitations
                   of that correspondence, extracting the radiation from
                   a large collection of roughly two hundred generic
                   black hole binary merger simulations both in the
                   simulation frame and in a corotating frame that
                   tracks precession. To a first approximation, the
                   corotating-frame waveforms resemble nonprecessing
                   analogs, based on similarity over a band-limited
                   frequency interval defined using a fiducial detector
                   (here, advanced LIGO) and the source's total mass
                   $M$. By restricting attention to masses $M\in 200,
                   2500 M_\odot$, we insure our comparisons are
                   sensitive only to our simulated late-time inspiral,
                   merger, and ringdown signals. In this mass region,
                   every one of our precessing simulations can be fit by
                   some physically similar member of the
                   \texttt{IMRPhenomB} phenomenological waveform family
                   to better than 95%; most fit significantly better.
                   The best-fit parameters at low and high mass
                   correspond to natural physical limits: the pre-merger
                   orbit and post-merger perturbed black hole. Our
                   results suggest that physically-motivated synthetic
                   signals can be derived by viewing radiation from
                   suitable nonprecessing binaries in a suitable
                   nonintertial reference frame. While a good first
                   approximation, precessing systems have degrees of
                   freedom (i.e., the transverse spins) which a
                   nonprecessing simulation cannot reproduce. We
                   quantify the extent to which these missing degrees of
                   freedom limit the utility of synthetic precessing
                   signals for detection and parameter estimation.},

                   wave (GW) detectors will begin operation in the
                   coming years, with compact binary coalescence events
                   a likely source for the first detections. The
                   gravitational waveforms emitted directly encode
                   information about the sources, including the masses
                   and spins of the compact objects. Recovering the
                   physical parameters of the sources from the GW
                   observations is a key analysis task. This work
                   describes the LALInference software library for
                   Bayesian parameter estimation of compact binary
                   coalescence (CBC) signals, which builds on several
                   previous methods to provide a well-tested toolkit
                   which has already been used for several studies. We
                   are able to show using three independent sampling
                   algorithms that our implementation consistently
                   converges on the same results, giving confidence in
                   the parameter estimates thus obtained. <br />We
                   demonstrate this with a detailed comparison on three
                   compact binary systems: a binary neutron star, a
                   neutron star-black hole binary and a binary black
                   hole, where we show a cross-comparison of results.
                   These systems were analysed with non-spinning,
                   aligned spin and generic spin configurations
                   respectively, showing that consistent results can be
                   obtained even with the full 15-dimensional parameter
                   space of the generic spin configurations. We also
                   demonstrate statistically that the Bayesian credible
                   intervals we recover correspond to frequentist
                   confidence intervals under correct prior assumptions
                   by analysing a set of 100 signals drawn from the
                   prior. <br />We discuss the computational cost of
                   these algorithms, and describe the general and
                   problem-specific sampling techniques we have used to
                   improve the efficiency of sampling the CBC parameter

  abstract =      {LIGO has detected gravitational waves from the
                   coalescence and merger of two massive stellar-origin
                   black holes. The detection is consistent with our
                   earlier predictions that the first LIGO detections
                   from massive binary black hole mergers were imminent,
                   based on isolated binary evolution. <br />Within our
                   classical evolutionary scenario we find that the
                   stellar progenitors of the black holes constituting
                   GW150914 most likely formed in low metallicity
                   environments (Z&lt;10% Zsun). We also find a bimodal
                   distribution for the formation time of GW150914, with
                   a peak only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang (z=3) and
                   another (30% lower) peak in the relatively recent
                   past at 11 Gyr (z=0.2). The typical channel for the
                   formation of GW150914 involves two very massive stars
                   (40-100 Msun) that interacted once through stable
                   mass transfer and once through common envelope
                   evolution, and both black holes formed without their
                   progenitors exploding as supernovae. The existence of
                   GW150914 indicates that large natal kicks (&gt;400
                   km/s) for massive black holes are unlikely.
                   Development and survival of the common envelope is
                   likely restricted to evolved stars. <br />While
                   models based on dynamical formation do not predict
                   that the BH spins should be preferentially aligned
                   with the binary angular momentum, our models of
                   isolated BH-BH formation favor aligned BH spins
                   (assuming that the progenitor star spins are aligned
                   when the binaries form). <br />We find that the
                   existence of GW150914 does not require enhanced
                   double black hole formation in dense stellar clusters
                   or via exotic evolutionary channels. Our standard
                   model BH-BH merger rate (200 Gpc^-3 yr^-1) is
                   consistent with the LIGO empirical estimate (2-400
                   Gpc^-3 yr^-1) and it is 40 times higher than the
                   typical rate of dynamically formed mergers. We
                   predict that BH-BH mergers with total mass of 20-80
                   Msun are to be detected next.},

                   object merger rate densities with initial and
                   forthcoming LIGO/Virgo upper limits. We find that:
                   (i) Due to the cosmological reach of advanced
                   detectors, current conversion methods of population
                   synthesis predictions into merger rate densities are
                   insufficient. (ii) Our optimistic models are a factor
                   of 18 below the initial LIGO/Virgo upper limits for
                   BH-BH systems, indicating that a modest increase in
                   observational sensitivity (by a factor of 2.5) may
                   bring the first detections or first gravitational
                   wave constraints on binary evolution. (iii)
                   Stellar-origin massive BH-BH mergers should dominate
                   event rates in advanced LIGO/Virgo and can be
                   detected out to redshift z=2 with templates including
                   inspiral, merger, and ringdown. Normal stars (&lt;150
                   Msun) can produce such mergers with total redshifted
                   mass up to 400 Msun. (iv) High black hole natal kicks
                   can severely limit the formation of massive BH-BH
                   systems (both in isolated binary and in dynamical
                   dense cluster evolution), and thus would eliminate
                   detection of these systems even at full advanced
                   LIGO/Virgo sensitivity. We find that low and high
                   black hole natal kicks are allowed by current
                   observational electromagnetic constraints. (v) The
                   majority of our models yield detections of all types
                   of mergers with advanced detectors. Numerous massive
                   BH-BH merger detections will indicate small (if any)
                   natal kicks for massive BHs. These systems would also
                   shed light on the merger origin, possibly
                   distinguishing mergers arising from field binary

                   investigate systems which are extremely difficult to
                   handle analytically. In the particular case of
                   general relativity, numerical models have proved
                   extremely valuable for investigations of strong-field
                   scenarios and been crucial in revealing unexpected
                   phenomena. Considerable efforts are being spent to
                   simulate astrophysically relevant simulations,
                   understand different aspects of the theory and even
                   provide insights into the search for a quantum theory
                   of gravity. In this paper I review the present status
                   of the field of numerical relativity, describe the
                   techniques most commonly used and discuss open
                   problems and (some) future prospects.},

                   standards for model waveforms which are sufficient to
                   ensure that these data analysis applications are
                   capable of extracting the full scientific content of
                   the data, but without demanding excessive accuracy
                   that would place undue burdens on the model waveform
                   simulation community. These accuracy standards are
                   intended primarily for broad-band model waveforms
                   produced by numerical simulations, but the standards
                   are quite general and apply equally to such waveforms

                   approach is based on a frequency domain matching of

                   relativity based binary black hole coalescence

                   post-Newtonian and numerical relativity waveforms,
                   and we use a matching criteria based on minimizing

                   ("intermediate-mass'', or IMBH) spinning black holes.
                   Black hole spin is known to have a significant impact
                   on the orbit, merger signal, and post-merger ringdown
                   of any binary with non-negligible spin. In
                   particular, the detection volume for spinning
                   binaries depends significantly on the component black
                   hole spins. We provide a fit to the single-detector
                   and isotropic-network detection volume versus (total)
                   mass and arbitrary spin for equal-mass binaries. Our
                   analysis assumes matched filtering to all significant
                   available waveform power (up to l=6 available for
                   fitting, but only l&lt;= 4 significant) estimated by
                   an array of 64 numerical simulations with component
                   spins as large as S_{1,2}/M^2 &lt;= 0.8. We provide a
                   spin-dependent estimate of our uncertainty, up to
                   S_{1,2}/M^2 &lt;= 1. For the initial (advanced) LIGO

                   fits assuming incomplete information, such as the
                   neglect of higher-order harmonics. We briefly discuss
                   how a strong selection bias towards aligned spins

  abstract =      {Coalescing binary black holes are a primary science
                   target of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors,
                   which require detailed knowledge of the expected
                   waveforms to maximize detections and our
                   understanding of the waves' sources. This paper
                   presents a catalog of numerical binary black- hole
                   simulations that represents a major advance toward
                   the application of numerical relativity to
                   gravitational-wave data analysis. Specifically, the
                   catalog contains 171 numerical simulations that
                   maintain the high accuracy required for matched
                   filtering while following more orbits (up to 33) than
                   previous simulations. A larger number of orbits
                   allows a more reliable connection to approximate
                   analytical waveforms, which are used to extend
                   numerical waveforms to span the entire frequency
                   range of a detector. The catalog contains 91
                   precessing binaries, providing the most comprehensive
                   survey of precessing systems to date, and includes
                   waveforms with black-hole spins up to 0.97, mass
                   ratios up to 8, and orbital eccentricities from a few
                   percent to 1e-4. With this combination of length,
                   accuracy, and parameter-space coverage, the catalog
                   can be used to significantly improve existing
                   gravitational-wave templates (including precessing
                   binaries), to study detection efficiency of
                   gravitational-wave searches, and to quantify
                   systematic biases of parameter estimation of detected

 abstract = {  The recent direct detection of gravitational waves has further emphasized the need for fast, low- cost, and accurate methods to infer the parameters of gravitational wave sources. The performance of these calculations is limited by the cost of evaluating the likelihood function, due to expense in data handling and waveform generation. Building on recently developed surrogate models and a novel parameter estimation pipeline, we show how to quickly generate the likelihood function as a simple, analytic closed-form expression. Using a simple variant of a production-scale parameter estimation code, we demonstrate our method using surrogate models of effective-one-body and numerical relativity waveforms. Our study is the first time these models have been used for parameter estimation and one of the first ever PE calculations with multi-modal numerical relativity waveforms. Our grid-free method enables rapid parameter estimation for any waveform with a suitable reduced-order model. The methods described in this paper may also find use in other data analysis pipelines, such as vetting coincident events or the computation of the coalescing-compact-binary detection statistic.},

                   gravitational-waveform templates against the output
                   of laser-interferometric gravitational-wave
                   detectors. The estimates are most sensitive to the
                   accuracy with which the phases of the template and
                   signal waveforms match over the many cycles received
                   in the detector frequency bandwidth. Using a recently
                   calculated formula, accurate to second post-Newtonian
                   (2PN) order [order (v/c)4, where v is the orbital
                   velocity], for the frequency sweep (dF/dt) induced by
                   gravitational radiation damping, we study the
                   statistical errors in the determination of such
                   source parameters as the ``chirp mass'' scrM, reduced
                   mass Œº, and spin parameters Œ≤ and œÉ (related to
                   spin-orbit and spin-spin effects, respectively). We
                   find that previous results using template phasing
                   accurate to 1.5PN order actually underestimated the
                   errors in scrM, Œº, and Œ≤. Templates with 2PN
                   phasing yield somewhat larger measurement errors
                   because the 2PN corrections act to suppress slightly
                   the importance of spin-orbit contributions to the
                   phase, thereby increasing the measurement error on
                   Œ≤. This, in turn, results in larger measurement
                   errors on scrM and Œº because of the strong
                   correlations among the parameters. For two
                   inspiraling neutron stars, the measurement errors
                   increase by less than 16%.},

                   produce a rich gravitational wave signal, encoding
                   the binary's nature and inspiral kinematics. Using
                   the lalinference\_mcmc Markov-chain Monte Carlo
                   parameter estimation code, we use two fiducial
                   examples to illustrate how the geometry and
                   kinematics are encoded into the modulated
                   gravitational wave signal, using coordinates
                   well-adapted to precession. Even for precessing

                   parameter estimation can be estimated by "effective"

                   nearest neighbors, adopting a fixed sky location and
                   idealized two-detector network. We use detailed and

                   nonzero but small local improvement when estimating
                   the parameters of precessing BH-NS binaries. That
                   said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter
                   estimation accuracy for precessing binaries ruling
                   out approximately-degenerate source orientations. <br
                   />Our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave
                   measurements can provide, such as reliable component
                   masses and the precise orientation of a precessing
                   short gamma ray burst progenitor relative to the line
                   of sight. "Effective" estimates may provide a simple
                   way to estimate trends in the performance of
                   parameter estimation for generic precessing BH-NS
                   binaries in next-generation detectors. For example,
                   our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate,
                   precession rate, and precession geometry are
                   roughly-independent observables, defining natural

                   Gravitational radiation encodes rich information
                   about source physics; thus parameter estimation and
                   model selection are crucial analysis steps for any
                   detection candidate events. Detailed models of the
                   anticipated waveforms enable inference on several
                   parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky
                   location and distance that are essential for new
                   astrophysical studies of these sources. However,
                   accurate measurements of these parameters and
                   discrimination of models describing the underlying
                   physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,
                   uncertainties in the waveform models and in the
                   calibration of the detectors. Here we report such
                   measurements on a selection of simulated signals
                   added either in hardware or software to the data
                   collected by the two LIGO instruments and the Virgo

                   including a "blind injection" where the signal was
                   not initially revealed to the collaboration. We

                   ringdown) of coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) for
                   initial and advanced ground-based interferometers
                   (LIGO-VIRGO) and for the space-based interferometer
                   LISA. Ground-based interferometers can do moderate
                   SNR (a few tens), moderate accuracy studies of BBH
                   coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000
                   solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 104),
                   high accuracy studies in the mass range of about
                   105-108 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first
                   sources detected by LIGO-VIRGO: they are visible to
                   much larger distances-up to 500 Mpc by initial
                   interferometers-than coalescing neutron star binaries
                   (heretofore regarded as the ``bread and butter''
                   workhorse source for LIGO-VIRGO, visible to about 30
                   Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to
                   50Msolar for initial LIGO interferometers, 100Msolar
                   for advanced, 106Msolar for LISA) are best searched
                   for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher
                   mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly
                   understood merger waves and/or their well-understood
                   ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for
                   massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be
                   capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about
                   100Msolar-700Msolar out to ~200 Mpc for initial LIGO
                   interferometers, and in the mass range of ~200Msolar
                   to ~3000Msolar out to about z=1 for advanced
                   interferometers. The required number of templates is
                   of the order of 6000 or less. Searches based on
                   merger waves could increase the number of detected
                   massive BBHs by a factor of the order of 10 over
                   those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without
                   detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a
                   noise monitoring search algorithm which we describe.
                   A full set of merger templates from numerical
                   relativity simulations could further increase the
                   number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up
                   to ~4.},

                   make it possible to calculate the final, most
                   powerful merger phase of binary black-hole
                   coalescence for generic binaries. The state of the
                   art has advanced well beyond the equal-mass case into
                   the unequal-mass and spinning regions of parameter
                   space. We present a study of the nonspinning portion
                   of parameter space, primarily using an analytic
                   waveform model tuned to available numerical data,
                   with an emphasis on observational implications. We
                   investigate the impact of varied mass ratio on merger
                   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for several detectors,
                   and compare our results with expectations from the
                   test-mass limit. We note a striking similarity of the
                   waveform phasing of the merger waveform across the
                   available mass ratios. Motivated by this, we
                   calculate the match between our 1:1 (equal mass) and
                   4:1 mass-ratio waveforms during the merger as a
                   function of location on the source sky, using a new
                   formalism for the match that accounts for higher
                   harmonics. This is an indicator of the amount of
                   degeneracy in mass ratio for mergers of
                   moderate-mass-ratio systems.},

                   applying symmetry constraints, we obtain a formalism

                   also makes a host of detailed quantitative
                   predictions for future BBH simulations, and suggests
                   a much more efficient way of mapping out the

                   holes on quasi-circular orbits. Besides recovering
                   the correct test-particle limit for extreme
                   mass-ratio binaries, our formula reproduces well the
                   results of all the numerical-relativity simulations
                   published so far, both when applied at separations of
                   a few gravitational radii, and when applied at
                   separations of tens of thousands of gravitational
                   radii. These validations make our formula a useful
                   tool in a variety of contexts ranging from
                   gravitational-wave physics to cosmology. As
                   representative examples, we first illustrate how it

                   effective-one-body waveforms during the ringdown

                   recently computed self-force correction to the
                   binding energy of nonspinning black-hole binaries, it
                   provides an estimate of the energy emitted during the
                   merger and ringdown. Finally, we use it to calculate
                   the energy radiated in gravitational waves by massive
                   black-hole binaries as a function of redshift, using

 abstract = {  The detection of the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by precessing binaries of spinning compact objects is complicated by the large number of parameters (such as the magnitudes and initial directions of the spins, and the position and orientation of the binary with respect to the detector) that are required to model accurately the precession-induced modulations of the GW signal. In this paper we describe a fast matched-filtering search scheme for precessing binaries, and we adopt the physical template family proposed by Buonanno, Chen, and Vallisneri [Phys.Rev.D 67, 104025 (2003)] for ground-based interferometers. This family provides essentially exact waveforms, written directly in terms of the physical parameters, for binaries with a single significant spin, and for which the observed GW signal is emitted during the phase of adiabatic inspiral (for LIGO-I and VIRGO, this corresponds to a total mass M &lt; 15Msun). We show how the detection statistic can be maximized automatically over all the parameters (including the position and orientation of the binary with respect to the detector), except four (the two masses, the magnitude of the single spin, and the opening angle between the spin and the orbital angular momentum), so the template bank used in the search is only four-dimensional; this technique is relevant also to the searches for GW from extreme--mass-ratio inspirals and supermassive blackhole inspirals to be performed using the space-borne detector LISA. Using the LIGO-I design sensitivity, we compute the detection threshold (~10) required for a false-alarm probability of 10^(-3)/year, and the number of templates (~76,000) required for a minimum match of 0.97, for the mass range (m1,m2)=[7,12]Msun*[1,3]Msun.},

  abstract={This paper presents a complete description of Virgo, the French-Italian gravitational wave detector. The detector, built at Cascina, near Pisa (Italy), is a very large Michelson interferometer, with 3 km-long arms. In this paper, following a presentation of the physics requirements, leading to the specifications for the construction of the detector, a detailed description of all its different elements is given. These include civil engineering infrastructures, a huge ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber (about 6000 cubic metres), all of the optical components, including high quality mirrors and their seismic isolating suspensions, all of the electronics required to control the interferometer and for signal detection. The expected performances of these different elements are given, leading to an overall sensitivity curve as a function of the incoming gravitational wave frequency. This description represents the detector as built and used in the first data-taking runs. Improvements in different parts have been and continue to be performed, leading to better sensitivities. These will be detailed in a forthcoming paper.}

 abstract = {  Current searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries use templates where the binary does not precess. By contrast, generic black hole-neutron star binaries will significantly precess, inducing modulations that nonprecessing searches are particularly ill-suited to recover. In this paper we provide a closed-form representation of the single-spin precessing waveform in the frequency domain by reorganizing the signal as a sum over harmonics, each of which resembles a nonprecessing waveform. This form enables simple analytic calculations (e.g., a Fisher matrix) and computationally fast frequency-domain templates. We have verified that our \texttt{SpinTaylorF2SingleSpin} model is faithful to the time-domain \texttt{SpinTaylorT2} model: for the majority of generic BH-NS binaries, the corresponding signals generated from each model agree to better than 1%. Our waveform model is now available as part of the publicly-available \texttt{lalsimulation} waveform-generation code.}

 abstract = {  Reliable low-latency gravitational wave parameter estimation is essential to target limited electromagnetic followup facilities toward astrophysically interesting and electromagnetically relevant sources of gravitational waves. In this study, we examine the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Specifically, we estimate the astrophysical relevance of systematic errors in the posterior parameter distributions derived using a fast-but-approximate waveform model, SpinTaylorF2 (STF2), in parameter estimation with lalinference_mcmc. Though efficient, the STF2 approximation to compact binary inspiral employs approximate kinematics (e.g., a single spin) and an approximate waveform (e.g., frequency domain versus time domain). More broadly, using a large astrophysically-motivated population of generic compact binary merger signals, we report on the effectualness and limitations of this single-spin approximation as a method to infer parameters of generic compact binary sources. For most low-mass compact binary sources, we find that the STF2 approximation estimates compact binary parameters with biases comparable to systematic uncertainties in the waveform. We illustrate by example the effect these systematic errors have on posterior probabilities most relevant to low-latency electromagnetic followup: whether the secondary is has a mass consistent with a neutron star; whether the masses, spins, and orbit are consistent with that neutron star's tidal disruption; and whether the binary's angular momentum axis is oriented along the line of sight.},

 abstract = {  Inferring astrophysical information from gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries is one of the key science goals of gravitational-wave astronomy. In order to reach the full scientific potential of gravitational-wave experiments we require techniques to mitigate the cost of Bayesian inference, especially as gravitational-wave signal models and analyses become increasingly sophisticated and detailed. Reduced order models (ROMs) of gravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost of inference by removing redundant computations. In this paper we construct the first reduced order models of gravitational-wave signals that include the effects of spin-precession, inspiral, merger, and ringdown in compact object binaries, and which are valid for component masses describing binary neutron star, binary black hole and mixed binary systems. This work utilizes the waveform model known as "IMRPhenomPv2". Our ROM enables the use of a fast \textit{reduced order quadrature} (ROQ) integration rule which allows us to approximate Bayesian probability density functions at a greatly reduced computational cost. We find that the ROQ rule can be used to speed up inference by factors as high as 300 without introducing systematic bias. This corresponds to a reduction in computational time from around half a year to a half a day, for the longest duration/lowest mass signals. The ROM and ROQ rule are available with the main inference library of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, LALInference.},

 abstract = {  One of the main bottlenecks in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy is the high cost of performing parameter estimation and GW searches on the fly. We propose a novel technique based on Reduced Order Quadratures (ROQs), an application and data-specific quadrature rule, to perform fast and accurate likelihood evaluations. These are the dominant cost in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are widely employed in parameter estimation studies, and so ROQs offer a new way to accelerate GW parameter estimation. We illustrate our approach using a four dimensional GW burst model embedded in noise. We build an ROQ for this model, and perform four dimensional MCMC searches with both the standard and ROQs quadrature rules, showing that, for this model, the ROQ approach is around 25 times faster than the standard approach with essentially no loss of accuracy. The speed-up from using ROQs is expected to increase for more complex GW signal models and therefore has significant potential to accelerate parameter estimation of GW sources such as compact binary coalescences.},

   abstract={The two-body dynamics in general relativity has been solved perturbatively using the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. The evolution of the orbital phase and the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to a rather high order up to O(v^8), v being the characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter used in the PN expansion as well as the method pursued in solving the relevant differential equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families in the context of initial and advanced gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed in our analysis are those that are currently used by Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is the time-domain PN models TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt, the effective one-body (EOB) model, and the Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2. We examine the overlaps of these models with one another and with the prototype effective one-body model (calibrated to numerical relativity simulations, as currently used by initial LIGO) for a number of different binaries at 2PN, 3PN and 3.5PN orders to quantify their differences and to help us decide whether there exist preferred families that are the most appropriate as search templates. We conclude that as long as the total mass remains less than a certain upper limit M_crit, all template families at 3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are equally good for the purpose of detection. The value of M_crit is found to be ~ 12M_Sun for Initial, Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. From a purely computational point of view we recommend that 3.5PN TaylorF2 be used below Mcrit and EOB calibrated to numerical relativity simulations be used for total binary mass M > Mcrit.}
